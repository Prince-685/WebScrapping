#WebScrapping

In this project i have used Python selenium to scrap data from the url.

1.First you have to install all the dependencies from the requrirement.txt

2.Run the file "scrape.py" it will go through 20pages of url : "https://www.amazon.in/s?k=bags&crid=2M096C61O4MLT&qid=1653308124&sprefix=ba%2Caps%2C283&ref=sr_pg_1"
  and scrape following data from each page: 'Product Name'
                                            'Price'
                                            'Rating'
                                            'Url'
                                            'No. of Reviews'
  and generate a Bags.csv file containing the scraped data.
  Command to run file : "python scrape.py"

3.Now run file "hiting.py" it will firstly read the Bags.csv file and take Product_url and the hit each url to scrape more detail of the product.
  It will scrape 'ASIN','Product Description','Manufacturer' from the product url and the generates a "Bags_with_additional_data.csv" file with
  all the data scrapped about the product("S.no","ASIN", "Product Name", "Product URL", "Product Price", "Product Description", "Rating", "Number of Reviews", "Manufacturer")
